      <description>I have had foot surgery. I&amp;rsquo;m lying in bed now, with my foot on a pillow, recovering.
I delayed the surgery for a long time, over a year. In addition to putting off important work, I also put off fixing my body. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to write here why it took so long for me to make the decision.
A year ago my left foot was been giving me problems. It would hurt for a few days, then get better.</description>
