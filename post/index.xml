      <description>As part of some barely work related research I have been doing, I read some new sources on the discovery of helium. I have always loved the fact that helium was discovered on the Sun before it was discovered on the Earth. It seems like an amazing thing &amp;ndash; an entirely new element was discovered in the Sun, which no one had ever knew of before, and then only 13 years later it was discovered on the Earth.</description>

      <description>I have had foot surgery, and I&amp;rsquo;m lying in bed now, with my foot on a pillow, recovering.
 The surgery I delayed for a long time, over a year. Why delay then and why act now?
A year ago my left foot was been giving me problems. It would hurt for a few days, then get better. It could be after exercise, or for no obvious reason. I tried soft padded shoes and shoes with no padding.</description>
