      <description>Today is an interesting anniversary: the sixtieth anniversary of solar power in space. On 17 March 1958, the American satellite Vanguard 1 entered orbit, becoming the fourth satellite ever to do so, and the first to use solar power. Vanguard 1 was small enough to be held by a person in one hand &amp;ndash; 1.5 kg (3 lbs) in mass and 16 cm (6&amp;rdquo;) in diameter, or 76 cm (30&amp;rdquo;) wide including the antenna aerials.</description>

      <description>When you walk through the doors of the museum here in Melbourne, there is a gigantic entrance hall which contains the entire skeleton of a blue whale. Walking throughout the Museum, there are dinosaurs and insects, there are gemstones of translucent purple, milky blue, and a thousand other colours. There is an entire native rainforest in a room, with actual plants and trees and a pond full of fish. There is an extraordinary kids play room, with rope ladders going up a series of tunnels to a succession of rooms which go over your head and then back down again to the ground.</description>

      <description>Another story from the discovery of helium is when it was discovered on Earth in large quantities. As I wrote in part 1, helium is so light that it will escape into space over time, and there is almost no helium in ordinary air less than (0.0006%). When helium was first discovered, it was trapped in tiny amounts in rock, where it had been created by nuclear reactions (for example, in uranium ore).</description>

      <description>As part of some barely work related research I have been doing, I read some new sources on the discovery of helium. I have always loved the fact that helium was discovered on the Sun before it was discovered on the Earth. It seems like an amazing thing &amp;ndash; an entirely new element was discovered in the Sun, which no one had ever knew of before, and then only 13 years later it was discovered on the Earth.</description>
